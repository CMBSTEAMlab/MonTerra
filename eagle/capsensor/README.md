# Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor

This sensor is made up of two copper plates to form a capacitor with the dielectric
being whatever material is surrounding it. The higher the moisture content around
the sensor, the longer it takes to charge the capacitor.

# Future development

The size of the sensor and the length of the wires to it can dramatically 
affect the sensor readings. Consider adding circuitry to help compensate for wire
length or possibly making the plates much larger to make the effect of the wires
negligible.
